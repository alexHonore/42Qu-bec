<h2>A small binary maze game with basic graphics</h2>
<p>Using the 42's library minilibx, I had a school project named so_long that make a game of a .ber file that supports 1(walls), 0(floor), C(collectibles), E(exits), P(player). Also, they added a verification step that allowed the game to launch only if the map is solvable, so I inplemented this functionallity. Have fun :) </p>
